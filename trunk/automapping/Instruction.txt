in consts.py

make sure the input and output name are the same as in ableton, in the Midi Preference window : example : Input : nanoKONTROL 2 (input), Output : nanoKONTROL 2 (output).

make sure in consts.py that the macro 1 refers to the correct CC : example : 
GENERIC_ENC1 = 16
GENERIC_ENC2 = 17
GENERIC_ENC3 = 18
GENERIC_ENC4 = 19
GENERIC_ENC5 = 20
GENERIC_ENC6 = 21
GENERIC_ENC7 = 22
GENERIC_ENC8 = 23

means that macro 1 = CC16, macro 2 = CC17 etc.

put the KTRL folder in : C:\ProgramData\Ableton\Live\Resources\MIDI Remote Scripts
